# BasicCRUD
Currently, this project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application written in Python. It uses only one external module called 'eel'. Very underrated, imo.

99% of all logic is in the javascript.

Eel will serve the HTML and Javascript via sockets. Eel will open up a new window in Google Chrome (which is currently the default preset in Eel).

This can be expanded with a SQLITE database for storage/keeping the items you type into the input box in the main page.
